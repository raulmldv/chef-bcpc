# When we bring-up a new cluster, there are some circular dependencies that
# present themselves (depending on how roles are broken out).  This playbook
# attempts to resolve those dependencies before chef is used to converge
# each node so that things go smoothly.
#
# The list of dependencies we resolve in configure-web-server [1] and here [2]:
#   * [1] etcd requires bcpc::web-server (to obtain packages)
#   * [2] etcd-proxy (non-headnodes) requires etcd (headnodes)
#   * [2] calico-felix requires etcd-proxy or etcd-member
#
# In the future, we should move Consul, etcd, etc. out of Chef and into
# Ansible so these dependencies can be resolved more elegantly.
